# DSA-grind
# 💻 Bhavika’s DSA Practice Ground

This is where I practice DSA daily — solving problems from LeetCode, GFG, and coding rounds.  
Organized by topic: Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Trees, Stacks, Queues, and more.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `Arrays` – Two Sum, Kadane’s, etc.
- `Strings` – Palindrome, Anagrams, etc.
- `LinkedList` – Reverse, Cycle detection
- `StackQueue` – Valid Parentheses, MinStack
- `Tree` – Inorder, BFS, DFS
- `DP` – Fibonacci, Knapsack, etc.

## 🚀 Platforms I'm Using
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [GeeksforGeeks](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/)
- [InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/)

## 🌱 Goal
Sharpen problem-solving, improve speed, and crack placement rounds.
